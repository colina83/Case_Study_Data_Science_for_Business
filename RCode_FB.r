# However, the RÂ² value of ~ 30 % tells us that there are a lot of other factors that potentially affect the deviation. Hence it is not the single source of truth.


# Nr.3 MPT theory says that Material with a low thickness and/or a low width carried a lower weight per meter and hence
# took longer to process. Accordingly negative deviations in months with average or above RTR could be explained by this metric.
# Hence we need to plot thickness and width against RTR

# I need two additional column giving me the average width and thickness of the shift. then i can compare it to the delta ... Wait, maybe there is something else.
