# plausibility checks:
# weekday: number of weekdays within 6 months is unequal (Tuesday:only 63 observations, Friday/Saturday/Sunday: 74 observations)
      # shifts were omitted by Schultze by missing data or obviously erroneous data.
# shift type: in the data set, there are more Midday shifts reported (174) than night shifts (170) or early shifts (156)
