# Case_Study_Data_Science_for_Business
First case study for the Master in Management Analytics at the Mannheim Business School

This is simple a Markdown to explain our project

Quantitative Case Studies (30%) During the course, 

participants will part-take in the quantitative case study “Solid as Steel: Production Planning at ThyssenKrupp”. 
For the case study, participants will work in groups. 
Each group (team) is required to prepare a short model(s),analyses and recommendation outline.

In this outline, you should answer the following questions:

#1.Perform a univariate analysis and answer the following questions: 

What is the average number of strips per shift? 

Strips of which thickness cluster are the most common, and strips of which thickness cluster are the least common?

What are the minimum, average, and maximum values of delta throughput and RTR?\

Are there shifts during which the PPL processes strips of only steel grade 1, or of only steel grade 2, etc.?

#2.Can the RTR theory adequately explain the deviations from the planned production figures? Explain why or why not.


#3.Is the MPT theory sufficient to explain the deviations? Explain why or why not. 

#4.Develop a sound regression model that can be used to predict delta throughput based on the characteris-tics of the strips scheduled for production.Include only explanatory variables that have a coefficient with a 10% level of significance. 

#5.Interpret the coefficient of RTR for the PPL and provide a 90% confidence interval for the value of the co-efficient (in the population).

#6.A strip of thickness 1 and width 1 is replaced by a strip of thickness 3 and width 3. This change does not affect any other aspect of the production. Provide an estimate for the change in delta throughput. 

#7.The  table  below  shows  the  data  provided  by  the  production  engineers.  Because  of  major  upcoming maintenance on the PPL, only 84 shifts were planned for the month of May. Provide an estimate for the average  delta  throughput  per  shift  in  May  based  on  these  estimated  figures.  (The  actual  figures  are,  of course, still unknown.)

#8.Provide a 90% confidence interval for the average delta throughput per shift in May.

Your  model,  analysis  and  recommendation  outline  should  not  exceed  10  slides.  

A  handout  is  expected  for  the grading. 

Supporting charts or data can be included as an Appendix. Please hand in one hardcopy of handout at the beginning of the team presentation session on February 27that 12:00am.

Each group should be prepared to present the slides in-class. Each slide should summarize the answer of one of the eight case questions above. We will select four groups randomly to present their model(s), analysis results and recommendations. The model(s), analyses and recommendation outline and team effort will be graded on the following criteria:•Scope: Model and analyses appropriately scoped to make it a significant learning experience for the team and the class.•Fact base: Appropriate data acquired and used to support analysis and conclusions. •Analysis  &  conclusions:  Compelling  analysis  &  conclusions  that  are  well  supported  by  facts  and  logical reasoning.•Course linkages: Use of appropriate model and statistical analysis approaches discussed in the course.•Presentation: Well-structured discussionwith clear flow and effective response to the questions above.
